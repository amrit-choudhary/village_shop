# Game Design

## Economy parameters
- cost          [1]
- price         [2]
- demand        [3]
- supply

## Village parameters
- population
- rate of growth

## Bank
- loan
- rate of interest

## Shop
- level         [4]
- cash
- stock
- preference    [5]
- discout       [6]
- P/L

## Notes
[1] cost with stock market like simulation.
[2] same as 1.
[3] demand depends on pop.
[4] level determines how many customers served per day.
[5] depends on repeat customers.
[6] shop wise discout that affects preference and P/L.

## Simulation
This is a discrete day wise simulation. At the end of 1 round(1 day) all the parameters will be calculated.
